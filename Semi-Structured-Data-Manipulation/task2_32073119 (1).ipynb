Yes, it's that good.However, in order to enjoy this book, you need to be a reader that appreciates a blend of high-energy action adventure spiced with some steamy romance.  I adore well-written time travel stories and this book exceeded my expectations.  In fact, Ms. Jackson does such exceptional world building in her novel that I felt I was actually seeing a movie with great dialogue! Sights, sounds, smells were so wonderfully portrayed that I felt I was actually in the middle of all the action. When the h swung her blade, I swung a blade and when she fought the assassins, I was fighting right along side with her....Yes, this book is for all of us who can cheer a smart, strong self-sufficient female warrior handling herself in any situation (while still maintaining her humanity) and flinch at the typical simpering, whimpering, helpless, sweet female heroines.I was hooked from the beginning of the book to the very last page. I won't give you any spoilers but the story is about a highly trained black ops agent who after an emotionally devastating mission goes into hiding from her own agency who have sent assassins to eliminate her.  She finds a way to go back in time to the early Viking period where her warrior skills are highly valued.The Kindle price is a bit more than I normally pay but it was so worth it.  I also purchased Ms. Jackson's other time travel, Timeless Knights, which I equally devoured with pleasure!I truly hope in the near future that Ms. Jackson gives David his own time travel novel.  Ms. Jackson, please focus your energies in this genre as there are so few well written time travel novels available.</td>\n",

       "3  Her Place in Time is my 500th Kindle book since I began reading e-books in 2010. Her Place in Time is one of the rare books I would rate at 6+ Stars! Yes, it's that good.However, in order to enjoy this book, you need to be a reader that appreciates a blend of high-energy action adventure spiced with some steamy romance.  I adore well-written time travel stories and this book exceeded my expectations.  In fact, Ms. Jackson does such exceptional world building in her novel that I felt I was actually seeing a movie with great dialogue! Sights, sounds, smells were so wonderfully portrayed that I felt I was actually in the middle of all the action. When the h swung her blade, I swung a blade and when she fought the assassins, I was fighting right along side with her....Yes, this book is for all of us who can cheer a smart, strong self-sufficient female warrior handling herself in any situation (while still maintaining her humanity) and flinch at the typical simpering, whimpering, helpless, sweet female heroines.I was hooked from the beginning of the book to the very last page. I won't give you any spoilers but the story is about a highly trained black ops agent who after an emotionally devastating mission goes into hiding from her own agency who have sent assassins to eliminate her.  She finds a way to go back in time to the early Viking period where her warrior skills are highly valued.The Kindle price is a bit more than I normally pay but it was so worth it.  I also purchased Ms. Jackson's other time travel, Timeless Knights, which I equally devoured with pleasure!I truly hope in the near future that Ms. Jackson gives David his own time travel novel.  Ms. Jackson, please focus your energies in this genre as there are so few well written time travel novels available.   \n",

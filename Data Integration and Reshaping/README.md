## Task 2: data reshaping  

observe and explain their effect assuming we want to
develop a linear model to predict the “House_quarterly_growth” using
“Median_house_price”, “House_twelve_month_growth”,
“House_average_annual_growth” attributes. When reshaping the data, we have two main
criteria. First, we want our features to be in the same scale and second, we want our features to
have as much linear relationship as possible with the target variable (i.e.,
House_quarterly_growth). You need to first explore the data to see if any scaling or
transformation is necessary
